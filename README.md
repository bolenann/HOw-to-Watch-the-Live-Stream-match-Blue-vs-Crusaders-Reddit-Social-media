Based on Blues and Crusaders performances in Super Rugby Pacific 2025, the tournament is shaping up to be a hard-nosed tournament for rugby's historical significance. The most recent games have shown both sides showing their power and their fighting spirit.
Details of a recent match:
The Crusaders beat the Blues, April 22, 25, live at Eden Park. Correct answer is 3028 meaning the Crusaders won offensively. Chay Fihaki, Kyle Preston, and Sevu Reece all crossed the whitewash for a combined six tries, with Taha Kemara converting several of those. Dalton Papalii and Finlay Christie helped the Blues reach more than two tries. Nevertheless, the Crusaders managed to hide their campaign because they applied a much better plan. But the Crusaders played the game to win, with more runs, more meters, more clean breaks, more defenders beaten, and more (and correct) stops than the Blues. To put it another way, they won.
On April 1, 2025, the Crusaders achieved a 42–19 victory at Eden Park over the Blues. It was a match that featured numerous attempts, intelligent kicking and an excellent set piece effort. In the opening few minutes of the match Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie all made plays that helped the Crusaders lead. The Blues tried hard but couldn't bring the same aggression as the Crusaders. However, it was the Crusaders who were the team that controlled the whole game.
The Crusaders managed to put behind their March 19, 2025 visit to Eden Park in the best possible way: still awaiting a Blues team that only lasted 41–19. For all that both teams managed to score tries in the match, the Crusaders were much more ruthless behind the try line while providing a very prudent, chance-free defense. It was hard work for the Blues to contain that relentless attacking wave that was dictated by players like Fihaki, Williams and Havili. The Blues took an early lead, only for it to disappear.
The traditional settler vs. the challenger:
The Crusaders and Blues have played each other in the 42 years since Super Rugby began. The Crusaders have won 32 games, while the Blues have 12 wins and one draw. That record is quite extraordinary, especially over their last 18 games where they have won 17.
From its inception, the rivalry has always been about fierce contests, memorable playoff seasons, and a tinge of "bad blood" linked to a strand of shared respect. They include most notably the Crusaders' victory over the Blues in the final of the Super Rugby competition at Eden Park in 2022, claiming their eleventh championship in the process. Out of nowhere, the Blues can finally take a snap out of their long winning streak.
Few are as highly anticipated as the head-to-head duels between Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo'unga to see how they affect the results. These competitors are the big players in the meetings that are ongoing.
2025 Team Performance and Stats
In the last few matches, the Crusaders not only scored more runs (1048 vs. 982), they also scored more cleans breaks (66 vs. 41) and tackles and defenders beaten (215 vs. 162).
Their coaching staff, head by Rob Penney, has done a tremendous job at keeping their squad focused on going out there and performing on a week to week basis.
To summarize:
In all of the Crusaders matches the Blues have played against them in 2025, they have been the better team, they have won all of their most recent matches comfortably. The games have been physically taxing, strategically nuanced and emotionally draining, because Super Rugby Pacific is a pressure cooker championship. The Crusaders have no doubt won more games in the past and more recently too, but the Blues will still continue to be a tough opponent capable of threatening that dominance
